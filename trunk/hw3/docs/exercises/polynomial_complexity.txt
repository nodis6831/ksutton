# EXERCISE 8.4

	a. Explain why the direct evaluation of a polynomial of the form
	
		....
		
		runs in theta(n^2) time.
		
		### 
		# ANSWER
		
		For each polynomial term raised to the nth degree, the n+1 degree requires a factor of 2 greater computations.
		For example:
			
			x^2 + 2x + 1 
				requires 2 multiplication and 2 addition computations
			
			while
			
			x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 
				requires 5 multiplication and 3 addition computations
			
			and finally
			
			x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 
				requires 9 multiplication and 4 addition computations

	b. Explain why Horner's method, evaluating polynomials of the form
	
		...
		
		runs in theta(n) time.
		
		###
		# ANSWER
		
			By factoring down the polynomial using Horner's method, the number of computations
			required for a polynomial of the nth degree versus a polynomial of the n+1 degree
			increases linearly, not exponentially.
			
			For example:
			
				x^2 + 2x + 1 
					requires 1 multiplication and 2 addition computations
			
				while
				
				x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 
					requires 2 multiplication and 3 addition computations
			
				and finally
				
				x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1
					requires 3 multiplication and 4 addition computations
