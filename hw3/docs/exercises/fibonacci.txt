# EXERCISE 10.5

	The Towers of Hanoi program performs seven disk moves for three disks. How many disk moves moves are performed for...
	
		a. 4 disks?
		
			2^4 - 1 = 15 moves
		
		b. 5 disks?
		
			2^5 - 1 = 31 moves
		
		c. n disks?
		
			2^n - 1
			
			Base case:
				First, let us assume that that 2^n - 1 yields the total number of moves required
				to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem for n disks. If n = 1, then 2^1 - 1 = 1. It
				only takes one move to solve the problem for one disk.
				
			Inductive step:
				Now, we prove that 2^(n) - 1 yields the proper solution for n+1. So, we compute 
				2^(n+1) - 1 = 2*2^n - 1. Then 2^(n+1) - 1 = 2^(n+1) - 1. Therefore 2^(n) - 1 is the
				correct solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem for n disks.
