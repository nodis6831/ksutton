# EXERCISE 8.1

	Suppose that list1 has size 4 and list2 is created by cloing list2 like this:
	
	Object list2 = list1.clone();
	
	How many new objects will this statement create?
	

	### ANSWER
	
	Well, depending on what the book exactly means by clone, it will either create 1 or 5 new objects.
	
	If it's a smart clone method, it will create 4 new objects inside the list and a new instance of a list class.
	
	If it's a stupid clone method, it will just create a new list linked to the 4 objects in list1. That would be bad :(.
