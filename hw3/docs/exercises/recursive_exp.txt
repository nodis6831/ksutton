# EXERCISE 10.12

	Prove that the recursive version of the exp() method in Section 10.8
	on page 315 runs in theta(lg n) time. Let T(n) be the run time for
	n > 0, and explain why T(n) = c + T(n/2) for some constant c > 0, and
	then forumulate an argument similar to that for Forumula 10.2 on page 314.
	
	> exp method from Section 10.8:
	
		double exp(double x, int n) {
			double factor = (n%2 == 0  1.0 : x); 	// 1 if x is even; else x;
			if (n < 2) return factor;				// base
			return factor*exp(x*x, n/2);			// recursion
		}
